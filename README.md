A few notes:
I had very little time to work on this so I decided to first build for a two player game and then refactor for adding 
additional players. I'll be happy to do that if you'd like. 

I started a unit test in jasmine but ran out of calander. 

I used a scaffolding tool to create the directory and thats why there are so many files. 

I spent about 3 hours on this. With a couple more I could have the additional player feature installed.

With another 1-2 hours I coudl have the unit test complete.
